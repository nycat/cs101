# Understanding Streams

This chapter helps you to transfer your mindset from synchronous into a asynchronous one in coding.

## Synchronous vs. asynchronous computing

Synchronous excution occurs when each block of code must wait for the previous block to complete before runing.

Javascript is a single-threaded language in nature, which means a long-runing task will block the the tasks behind it.

### avaible solutions

- Non-blocking code with callback functions
  - runtime system(caller)
  - inversion of control

### shortcoming of aynchronous programing

- Where synchronous programs allow us to reason about directly the state of the applicaito, asynchornous code forces us to reason about its future state.

- State can be understodd simpy as a snapshot of all the informations stored into variables at any point in time.
